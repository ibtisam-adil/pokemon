<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 🎬 AwesomeBooks <a name="about-project"></a>

"Pokemon" is a JavaScript web app that brings Pokémon to life with a dynamic interface and intuitive navigation. Users choose from rock, water, fire, and lightning Pokémon types, floating around a Pokeball. Leveraging an external API, the app fetches Pokémon data, enabling exploration and interaction through liking and commenting features. Implemented with classes, these features seamlessly integrate with the API for a smooth user experience.
